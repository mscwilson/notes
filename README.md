## Notes

A personal note-taking webapp, in vanilla JavaScript.


### Description
This was a team project for week 7 of the 12-week [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) coding bootcamp. There was an extra challenge during this work in that we were asked not to use any existing libraries. The goals were:  
* Practise JavaScript, HTML and CSS
* Learn how to interact with the DOM using vanilla JavaScript
* * Create a Single Page App
* Create our own basic testing framework  

Try it out [on my GitHub Pages site](https://mscwilson.github.io/notes).

It looks like this:
